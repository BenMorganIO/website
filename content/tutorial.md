Before you start, it's a good idea to have some background into [GraphQL in general](/learning-graphql).

## The Example

We'll be building a very basic GraphQL API for a blog, written in Elixir using
Absinthe. The tutorial expects you to have a properly set-up [Phoenix application](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/up-and-running) with <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/absinthe">absinthe</a> and <a href="https://hex.pm/packages/absinthe_plug">absinthe_plug</a> added to the dependencies.

<p class="notice">
  If you'd like to cheat, you can find the finished code for the tutorial
  in the <a href="https://github.com/absinthe-graphql/absinthe_example">Absinthe Example</a>
  project on GitHub.

Let's get started!
